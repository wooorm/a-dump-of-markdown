# a dump of markdown

This repo houses 1.5mb of markdown and a script to test [micromark] against it,
for performance reasons.

## Use

```sh
# get micromark, and link it
git clone git@github.com:micromark/micromark.git
cd micromark
npm install
npm test
npm link
cd ..
# get this repo, link micromark into it
git clone git@github.com:wooorm/a-dump-of-markdown.git
cd a-dump-of-markdown
npm install
npm link micromark
```

Now you can profile Node:

```sh
# process the markdown in node (e.g., see: <https://v8.dev/docs/profile>)
node --prof example
```

Or to profile in a browser:

```sh
# build a version for a browser.
npm run build
# open `index.html` in default browser.
open index.html
```
